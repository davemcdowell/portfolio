{% capture aboutMe %}
I'm a designer and developer of many things with a knack for making levels, games and a good amount of front-end web experience on the side. I started my interest with game development using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_(game_engine)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BUILD Engine</a> and playing tons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Duke 3D</a> back in 1996. Around the same time I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft FrontPage</a>, so making websites became a thing in my life too.
Since then I've done a bit of everything when it comes to games&mdash;level design, scripting, sound foley, 2D/3D art and animation, game/level mechanics programming. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design from <a href="https://www.cornish.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cornish College of the Arts</a> and an Associate of Applied Science in Interactive Media from <a href="https://www.cscc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Columbus State Community College</a>.
