          <p>A PCGamer spread from March 2001 covering the category for 'Best of the Year' with the HL1 version of Firearms taking the spot for 'Best Mod'. 
          Firearms also snagged a runner up position along side Quake 3 Arena as 'Best Multiplayer Game'; with Red Alert 2 taking the top (nice!).</p>

          <p>A PCGamer spread from March 2001 called Extended Play written by Dan Morris which covered Add-ons, patches, upgrades and mods for popular games of the time.
          His article here titled 'Agents of Change' speaks on the need for the game industry (at the time) to look more into hiring mod developers. Long story short Firearms gets a warm, fuzzy mention here worth reading.</p>

          <p>In this article Dan calls 2001 the 'Year of the Mod' as well as naming Firearms Game of the Year and a product that surpassed the ambitions of the original professional developers.
          <em>I'm looking at you Valve.</em></p>

          <p>The Letters to the Editor section from PCGamer March 2001 issue has some amusing letters from the time, one in particular is titled "That Boy Ain't Right" which the writer calls out PCGamers previews editor,
          Jeremy Williams love of the "cheesy" AUG in Half-Life Firearms  - which is apparently a 42-round clipped, scoped, rifle for campers in their AK-47 loving opinion.</p>

          <p>I'm still looking for the issue where Jeremy Williams mentions Firearms and his love for the AUG, I'll post it here when I find it.</p>
