          A PC Gamer article from March 2001 covering the category for "Best of the Year" with the HL1 version of Firearms taking the spot for "Best Mod".
          This excerpt from the article pretty much sums up Firearms perfectly. <em>"Firearms was the most fun many of us had at a PC in the year 2000. For sheer, unadulterated 
          excitement, nothing else really came close."</em> Firearms also snagged "Best Multiplayer Game" along side Quake 3 Arena as a runner up (Wowza!). Take PC Gamers word "...a better multiplayer game than most professionally produced products released in 2000."
          Very true statement, I remember applying to VGL many years later after reading this and playing FA and being excited to be apart of something so awesome with such a great team.
